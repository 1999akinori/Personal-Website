                            Hello there, my name is Akinori Kimura. I am in my second year of electrical engineering at the University of Toronto.
                            The past sumer, as an intern at Parque Metropolitano in Santiago, Chile, I worked to promote environmental consciousness  
                            by leading workshops with children and helping organize events with a team. To expand my skillset,
                            I learned web development and built this personal website. Through my role as class rep, I am actively 
                            involved in improving the social and academic experience of my community. 
                            At the moment, I am trying leverage the unlimited opportunities I have as a student to learn as much as I can and grow from the interactions.
                            <br>

                                    <p>Here are some things I love to do</p>
                                    <ul> 
                                        
                                        <li>
                                            Problem solving and thinking through programming, board games, physics, and math.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Exploring and traveling. I was born in Swizterland and have lived in 6 other countries (Peru, 
                                                Japan, Nepal, Costa Rica, Canada, Chile). I love learning from different cultures and traveling sparks the curiosity inside me.

                                        <li>
                                            I love playing basketball and going to the gym.
                                            I can also get pretty heated talking about Arsenal or the Japanese Football team. Every World Cup is literally the best time of my life. 
                                            Breaking a sweat with a workout in the gym or playing basketball or tennis. I am also a passionate fan of Arsenal Football Club and my Japanese
                                             national team for football.

                                            Learning languages. I didn't quite appreciate language learning in high school, but now I find joy in it. I can 
                                            fluently speak Japanese and English, and Spanish at an advanced/intermediate level.

                                        While I was at university, my parents told me that they were moving to Chile. 
                                        I knew nothing about Chile, or for that matter, anyone except my family, 
                                        but I was thrilled to spend my summer there. Checkout what I learned about Chile in the 3 months I was thre.

                                                This was where I truely learned to enjoy learning. Being surrounded by smart and talented students, as well as 
                                                passionate teachers, I am grateful for the position I was in. Outside of class, I played for the varsity basketball team and the ultimate frisbee team.
                                                I grew a lot through sports as an individual and a leader, especially in the international AASCA tournaments.
                                                I also frequently volunteered for a girls orphanage called Hogar Montial.
