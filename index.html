                                        I knew nothing about Chile, or for that matter, anyone except my family, 
                                        but I was thrilled to spend my summer there. Checkout what I learned about Chile in the 3 months I was thre.

                                    countries: Swizterland, Peru, Japan, Nepal, Costa Rica, Canada, and Chile. Since I was a kid, I've had a fascination with insects, 
                                    especially beetles, obsessing over their armor-like body and unique behavior. 
                                    My love for nature and wildlife, has led me to my recent attempt 
                                    to capture my observation through <a href="./photogallery.html">photography</a>. My attention to detail and observation 
                                    are also portrayed in my drawings.</p>

                                    What I observe with my eyes, I try to understand.
                                    My drive for learning and constant curiosity makes not knowing very very uncomfortable. Perhaps it is why physics has 
                                    been my favorite course. Sharing my understanding through teaching gives me great fullfillment.
                                    As I have grown, I have gained more of an appreciation for the unique cultures of countries around the world. 
                                    The desire to understand these different cultures has added a new level of enjoyment to travelling and has motivated my 
                                    desire to become fluent in Spanish and learn many other languages in the future.

                                    I feel like my whole life has prepared me to adapt to external change. As I changed countries, I've had to make new connections, learn a new language,
                                    adapt to a completely new culture, give up on good Japanese food, give up on good wifi, and more. While I still have fears and 
                                    anxiety about change, I am confident I will find a solution to whatever difficulty I may face.
                                    Internally, I am always looking to improve myself. The growth I made through my fitness journey, kickstarted my obssession for learning and self-improvement.
                                    I chose engineering because I want to be an agent of positive change. While it may be 10-20 years down the line, I want to see my design and innovation change lives.
